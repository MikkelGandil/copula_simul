# Introduction

This repo contains a notebook showing how to simulate bivariate distributions with a known Gaussian copula.

I have used this code for analysis of the interplay between gender inequality and intergenerational mobility estimates. See [this paper](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rwdfCWnyD3ZIto24HHYGpFCRPXFkTzCz).

The code is available in a Jupyter Notebook
A static version is available in HTML
